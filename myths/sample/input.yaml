        #Hello, World!#
        This sample demonstrates how this tool can be used to create a slide
        presentation from a simple **YAML** file with content formatted using
        **Markdown** syntax.

        ##Controls##
        - `<Space>` to go forward
        - `p` to go back
        - `O` to open the options menu
      notes: |
        Notes can be used to assist you while giving the presentation.

    - slide: |
        #The second slide#
        This tool is written in **Ruby** using **RDiscount**'s implementation
        of **Markdown**.
        The slides are generated from a **Mustache** template.

        The next slide will introduce some formatting.
      notes: |
        Notes are optional. The next slide has no notes.

    - slide: |
        #Formatting#
        ##Lists##
        This is a simple *unordered* list:
        
        - one item;
        - another item;
        
        One can also create *ordered* lists:
        
        1. first item;
        1. second item.
